## About

Prism is a multi-chat service provided via a shared network between your peers.

It allows you to create, join, leave, and change chat channels with ease.

The underlying design follows the principles of a peer to peer network such as 
distributed computations, broadcasting queries, extendability, and no amount of centralization within the service.

The goal of Prism is simple: create a platform where peers can communicate, 
create small communities of similar interests, 
and allow unmonitored activity.

This makes it very easy for users to start short conversations on topics,
maintain multiple of these conversations at a time, 
chat with community members, 
and most importantly stay anonymous between peers.


## Usage

There are 2 Options for running Prism:
1) `prism <HOST-PORT>`
2) `prism <HOST-PORT> <CONNECT-IP> <CONNECT-PORTNO>`

Reminders
- Set your alias first!
- Share your connectivity information with discretion!
- run `ifconfig` for more information of your connection details.

Commands
- `/help`
- `/name <NAME>`
- `/connect <CONNECT-IP> <CONNECT-PORTNO>`
- `/exit`
